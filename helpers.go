// PUMP CODE â€” a circular buffer
// Copyright 2014 The Go Authors
//
// pumpEventAnnounces returns a channel src such that sending on src will eventually send on
// dst, in order, but that src will always be ready to send/receive soon, even
// if dst currently isn't. It is effectively an infinitely buffered channel.
//
// In particular, goroutine A sending on src will not deadlock even if goroutine
// B that's responsible for receiving on dst is currently blocked trying to
// send to A on a separate channel.
//
// Send a EventStopAnnounce event on the src channel to close the dst channel after all queued
// events are sent on dst. After that, other goroutines can still send to src,
// so that such sends won't block forever, but such events will be ignored.
